Description of the challenge is too straight forward but useless it says

## Recon 

Initial Recon is must in CTF challenges jumping directly on the Application will give a strong headache as a gift.

**Nmap**

```
nmap -Pn kicyber-{}-challenge-1.chals.io --vv -sV  
```

Servers are really slow :/

Tried accessing port 23 that is telnet but no sucess.

After Opening the URL in the browser I just got pranked!

But "Where's the Camera?"

**Directory Busting - Gobuster**

So there are mainly three endpoints with 200 Status code 

**/img - endpoint**

This indicates there is somewhere an endpoint through which we can register an account.

**robots.txt - endpoint**

but wait! when scrolling downside of the robots.txt

we got the endpoint 

# Exploitation - XXE Attack

When accessing the "/complexpage.html" endpoint we get a simple registration form

Let's enter details and Intercept request and response in Burpsuite

**Request :**

**Response :**

As it is XML version 1 and the value of "Email" is returned in the response let's try XXE Attack 

Those who don't know about the XXE Attack :

- XXE is a vulnerability present in the processing of the XML data. 
- In XML there are tags just like html but here the tags are user defined that represent some data that is also specified by the user.
- XXE stands for XML External Entity injection in which attacker uses external entity to retrieve data from the sever.
- External Entities are the tags who's values are stored in another location also in the files present on the server.

Now we just need to create a tag which will retrieve its values from a file present on the server and when we use that tag in our code content of that file will be returned.

```
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
```

using the xxe tag 

```
&xxe;
```

so reading the flag present at "/etc/flag "

## Conclusion 

In this Writeup we have learned how we can exploit an XXE Vulnerabilty and retrive sensitive files from ther server filesystem.
