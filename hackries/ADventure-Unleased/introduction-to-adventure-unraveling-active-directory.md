# Introduction to Active Directory

Active Directory Domain Services is a powerful tool for system administrators to manage and update operating systems, applications, users, and data access on a large scale. It serves as the backbone of a network, providing a centralized platform to oversee these vital aspects of an organization.

In the world of Active Directory, crucial information is stored as objects. These objects can be users, groups, or computers. Each object represents a distinct entity in the network.

Permission sets on objects dictate their privileges within the domain. This means that the level of access, control, and rights an object (such as a user, group, or computer) has is determined by the permissions assigned to it.

One of the strengths of Active Directory is its flexibility. It can be customized to suit the specific needs of any organization. The domain name, such as "corp.com," serves as the foundation, and administrators have the ability to add objects like users, groups, and computers, tailoring the structure to their requirements.

Objects within Active Directory are organized into Organizational Units (OUs). Think of OUs as analogous to folders in a file system; they act as containers for storing and managing objects. Objects within OUs are grouped logically for efficient administration.

Here's a brief overview of some fundamental objects in Active Directory:

- Computers: These objects represent servers and workstations, integral parts of the network.

- Users: User accounts are at the core of Active Directory. They enable individuals to access network resources securely.

Objects may have various attributes depending on their types, allowing for extensive customization.

The heart of Active Directory is the Domain Controller (DC). The DC plays a pivotal role in authentication, determining whether a user has login access to the domain or not. It stores OUs, objects, and their associated attributes.

Objects within Active Directory can be assigned to groups, which simplifies the management of multiple objects as a single unit. This aids administrators in efficiently overseeing various aspects of the network.

Domain Admins are among the most privileged entities within the domain. They wield significant power and responsibilities.

Active Directory isn't limited to a single domain; it can host multiple domains within a Domain Tree or even multiple Domain Trees in a Domain Forest. This hierarchical structure enables complex organizational configurations.

Enterprise Admins possess full control over all the domains in the Domain Forest and administrative privileges on all the Domain Controllers.
